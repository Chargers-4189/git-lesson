Wednesday Activity

Created By: Caleb & JD

Today, you will learn how Git and GitHub work by creating an application collaboratively. You'll also learn the basics of Git and the conventions to use when making a branch, pull request, or commit.

# Application Specs

Create a simple stock application that will generate profit. You will use the strategy of `buy low and sell high` for this application. Six stocks are available with different starting values and starting with varying levels of risk.

Here are the six companies and their details.

| Company                 | Coke   | Walmart | Google  | Nvidia  | Microsoft | Honey Well |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Starting Stock Value    | $64.38 | $91.88  | $169.43 | $136.02 | $422.99   | $230.60    |
| Starting Volatile Level | Low    | Medium  | High    | Medium  | High      | High       |

`50 Milliseconds = 1 Day`

These values will change every 50 milliseconds (configurable), representing one full day. The prices will randomly fluctuate and the choice to buy or sell during a cycle will depend on the graph. The Volatile Level is the chance of a stock's price fluctuating extremely or not much.

## Rules

Your application must meet these requirements to be complete.

| Starting Budget | $1,000   |
| --------------- | -------- |
| Target Goal     | $3,000   |
| Bonus Goal      | $5,000   |
| Time frame      | 365 Days |

1. The application must reach at least $3,000 by the 365th day (one year) from its starting budget of $1,000.
2. The application must track the amount of stock per company it purchases or sells daily.
3. The application must track the net worth of purchasing and selling of stocks.
4. On the 365th day, the application must report how many stocks it bought and sold for each company.
5. The application cannot take or give money from any outside methods. Change in balance must be done by the two methods of `buyStock()` and `sellStock()`.
6. You can only modify the code in the `/app/student` directory. You cannot modify the code in the `/app/src/` directory.
7. The application must surpass the $3,000 target around 50% of all random runs to pass the requirement.

## More Details

Use this example Stock Simulated Example to see the changes in data that occur with varying volatile levels.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This example was run without any shares purchased or sold on the stock market. When your app buys or sells a share, there is a miniscule change in price which will affect future stock prices. This is minimal and will still generate roughly the same shaped graph, but do not solely rely entirely on the graphs shown here.

Click here to view the Google Sheets: [Stock Simulated Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BrxBgBGBoQWM3y0zQTZ1_J-O4bmjuNbWNlnCV3NnQm4/edit?usp=sharing)

### Volatility Level

As mentioned before, the Volatile Level is the chance of a stock's price fluctuating extremely or not much. In other words, when it is LOW, the price change is minimal, only a couple of dollars change. When it is HIGH, the price change is substantial, tens or fifty dollars change. This is not directional; meaning at a HIGH level, the price will not always drastically increase. It can decrease the price immensely resulting in losses.

You can see the effects in this table:

| Google's Stock   | Day 163 | Day 164 | Day 165 | Day 166 | Day 167 | Day 168 | Day 169 | Day 170 | Day 171 | Day 172 |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Volatility Level | LOW     | LOW     | LOW     | LOW     | LOW     | HIGH    | HIGH    | HIGH    | HIGH    | HIGH    |
| Stock Price      | $100.55 | $100.72 | $100.71 | $96.44  | $97.35  | $97.07  | $87.92  | $88.43  | $103.13 | $123.28 |

Google's stock price dramatically dropped and rose when the volatility level switched to HIGH. Additionally, the LOW section where all of the price changes are within $5. You can see the difference between Day 169 and 170 is not much. This is because when volatility is HIGH, the chance of fluctuating extremely is more frequent, but regular changes can still occur.

A simple algorithm to use this feature:

> - As long as the volatility level is LOW or MEDIUM -> do not sell.
> - If the Volatility level is HIGH and the price has drastically decreased -> sell.
> - If the Volatility level is HIGH and the price has drastically increased -> do not sell.

LOW levels will typically represent peaks and troughs where it is stable. While MEDIUM and HIGH typically represent an increasing or decreasing stock price. You can incorporate much more complex algorithms that utilize past data to estimate. But remember that most of the fluctuations can be random and may drop to very low amounts.

### Debugging & Transcripts

We've added some tools to help you out in your program these include the debug, logs, transactions, and transcript.

<details>

<summary>Click to reveal</summary>

#### Debugging

Located in `Main.java`, you can find the log level suppression setting.

```java
private static final Logger log = new Logger(Logger.LogLevel.INFO);
// Example use of DEBUG:
private static final Logger log = new Logger(Logger.LogLevel.DEBUG);
```

You can change the `LogLevel` to four different levels:

- `DEBUG`: Used for detailed information useful during development and debugging. It includes information that's not typically needed during normal operation.

- `INFO`: Provides information about the normal operation of the application. These messages indicate that the system is functioning as expected.

- `WARN`: Indicates a potential problem that may not be critical but requires attention. The application might still be functioning correctly, but there's a possibility of future issues.

- `ERROR`: Signals a serious problem that has prevented the application from functioning correctly. These messages usually indicate an error condition that requires immediate attention.

If addition to the log level, the location of where the log event occurred is documented:

`2024-12-02T17:09:41.2157 [DEBUG]  [MARKET]:`

Use this diagram to understand what logs will be suppressed with each log level setting.

| Log Level Setting |  DEBUG Printed?  |  INFO Printed?   |  WARN Printed?   |  ERROR Printed?  |
| :---------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: |
|       DEBUG       | Yes (System.out) | Yes (System.out) | Yes (System.err) | Yes (System.err) |
|       INFO        |        No        | Yes (System.out) | Yes (System.err) | Yes (System.err) |
|       WARN        |        No        |        No        | Yes (System.err) | Yes (System.err) |
|       ERROR       |        No        |        No        |        No        | Yes (System.err) |

Example:

```bash
2024-12-02T17:09:41.2157 [DEBUG]  [MARKET]: Stock honeywell updated. Price: $228.47 | Volatility Level: LOW
2024-12-02T17:23:52.2265 [WARN]  [ACCOUNT]: Insufficient funds. Please make more money.
2024-12-02T17:23:52.2265 [WARN]  [MARKET]: Purchasing share failed: Transaction cancelled by account.
2024-12-02T17:23:52.2275 [DEBUG]  [ACCOUNT]: DEPOSIT: 179.3. New balance: $506.12762994365613
2024-12-02T17:23:52.2275 [DEBUG]  [MARKET]: Share sold from honeywell. Profit: $179.3 | Balance: $506.13 | Stock Price Now: $179.09
2024-12-02T17:23:52.2285 [ERROR]  [MARKET]: Company name lookup failed: Invalid company name provided: cokee
```

When `DEBUG` is set, the stock market will start logging all stock prices and volatility in `/app/logs/stock-market.csv` in a comma-separated sheet. This is in order listed like above. You can use this to plot data on a chart or test an algorithm with. The console will also output additional information to debug your application.

You can also let the application log to a file by setting the following in `Main.java` to true:

```java
public static final boolean logFile = false;
```

#### Account

The bank account for your application will automatically log all transactions to `/apps/logs/transaction.csv`. This will be used to test if your application is following the rules and for you to debug any issues.

Example:

```bash
# Order
# [TIMESTAMP],[TYPE],[AMOUNT],[DESCRIPTION],[BALANCE LEFT]
2024-12-02T17:25:28.7785,WITHDRAWAL,-338.18 ,Purchased 2 shares from honeywell.,3.7085227734557975
2024-12-02T17:25:28.7785,DEPOSIT   ,169.18  ,Sold 1 shares from honeywell.,172.89395795852232
```

#### transcript.txt

When you run your application inside VSCode, you can use the greater than operator `>` to redirect the output to a file. There's a preset file called `transcript.txt` that you can redirect this output to.

Use the up arrow to use a previous command (the one that runs the application). Then append this at the end of the command:

```bash
[Running Command] > ./app/logs/transcript.txt
```

Example:

```bash
#Before
c:; cd 'c:\pathToDirectory'; & 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin\java.exe' '-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages' '-cp' 'C:\pathToBin' 'app.src.Main'
# After
c:; cd 'c:\pathToDirectory'; & 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin\java.exe' '-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages' '-cp' 'C:\pathToBin' 'app.src.Main' > ./app/logs/transcript.txt
```

When you output to a transcript file, the formatting of the colors will not look the same:

```
2024-12-02T18:10:30.2522 [INFO] [32m[MARKET]:[0m [35mRandom Seed: 948573627495667526[0m
```

To avoid this, set `showConsoleColor` in `Main.java` to false. This will output the default color of the console so there are no formatting issues in the transcript.

```java
public static final boolean showConsoleColor = true;
// Set to false
public static final boolean showConsoleColor = false;
```

</details>

## Starter Code

Let's look in `/app/student/StockApp.java`

```java
package app.student;

import app.src.Account;
import app.src.Main;
import app.src.StockMarket;

public class StockApp extends Thread {

Â  private final StockMarket stockMarket;
Â  private final Account account;
Â  private static volatile boolean runApp = true;

Â  public StockApp(StockMarket stockMarket, Account account) {
Â  Â  this.stockMarket = stockMarket;
Â  Â  this.account = account;

Â  Â  // STOCK MARKET CONFIGURATIONS
Â  Â  Main.setMsPerDay(50); // Default 50. Use lower milliseconds for quicker testing.
Â  Â  Main.setMaxOpenDays(365); // Default 365. Use lower days for quicker testing.
Â  Â  stockMarket.setRandomSeed(948573627495667526L); // Set Stock Market generation seed. Set to 0 for random seed.
 }

Â  public void end() {
 runApp = false;
 }

 @Override
Â  public void run() {
Â  Â  while (runApp) {
Â  Â  Â  try {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Thread.sleep(Main.getMsPerDay());
 } catch (Exception e) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  e.printStackTrace();
Â  Â  Â  Â  Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 }
Â  Â  Â  // Your Code Here
Â  Â  Â  // Available Companies: coke walmart google nvidia microsoft honeywell

Â  Â  Â  // Below is an example code
Â  Â  Â  String company = "honeywell";
Â  Â  Â  double price = stockMarket.getStockPrice(company);
Â  Â  Â  String volatileLvl = stockMarket.getVolatileLevel(company);
Â  Â  Â  double balance = account.getBalance();

Â  Â  Â  System.out.println(
 company +
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  " | Volatile Level: " +
 volatileLvl +
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  " | Stock Price: " +
 price +
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  " | Balance: " +
 balance);

 }
 }
}

```

### Let's break it down

<details>
Â  <summary>Imports - Click to reveal</summary>
You don't need to worry about this portion of the app. It is importing the required dependencies for the app to work.

```java
package app.student;

import app.src.Account;
import app.src.Main;
import app.src.StockMarket;

public class StockApp extends Thread {

Â  private final StockMarket stockMarket;
Â  private final Account account;
Â  private static volatile boolean runApp = true;

Â  public StockApp(StockMarket stockMarket, Account account) {
Â  Â  this.stockMarket = stockMarket;
Â  Â  this.account = account;
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Configurations - Click to reveal</summary>
Here you can configure three configurations for the Stock Market.

- `Main.setMsPerDay()` - Sets the time step (in milliseconds) between simulation cycles. Each cycle represents one day. It is recommended to set the value above 50 to prevent calculation bugs when running the application rapidly. Changing the cycle may also change stock price results.
- `Main.setMaxOpenDays()` - Sets the maximum number of days the stock market will be open for in the simulation. Configure this to lower values for quick testing.
- `stockMarket.setRandomSeed()` - Sets the seed for the random number generator used in the stock market simulation. Setting a seed value other than 0 will produce repeatable results for the same seed value. Using a seed of 0 will use a randomly generated seed.
  Â  - Your app will start with the seed `948573627495667526L` as a benchmark. This just helps as a starting point so you can see what algorithm increases overall. However, your app will need to work regardless of the seed. Do not create algorithms solely around this seed, as it can fail with other random seeds.

```java

Â  Â  // STOCK MARKET CONFIGURATIONS
Â  Â  Main.setMsPerDay(50);
Â  Â  Main.setMaxOpenDays(365);
Â  Â  stockMarket.setRandomSeed(948573627495667526L);
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Code - Click to reveal</summary>

The Stock class is changing every second. So your application also needs to keep up with the thread, which is why it is in a loop with a `Thread.sleep()`. Inside the loop and after the `try_catch` is where your actual application will exist. You will use the given methods from `StockMarket` and `Account` to keep track of, purchase, and sell stocks.

```java
 @Override
Â  public void run() {
Â  Â  while (runApp) {
Â  Â  Â  try {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Thread.sleep(Main.getMsPerDay());
 } catch (Exception e) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  e.printStackTrace();
Â  Â  Â  Â  Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 }
Â  Â  Â  // Your Code Here
Â  Â  Â  // Available Companies: coke walmart google nvidia microsoft honeywell

Â  Â  Â  // Below is example code
Â  Â  Â  String company = "honeywell";
Â  Â  Â  double price = stockMarket.getStockPrice(company);
Â  Â  Â  String volatileLvl = stockMarket.getVolatileLevel(company);
Â  Â  Â  double balance = account.getBalance();

Â  Â  Â  System.out.println(
 company +
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  " | Volatile Level: " +
 volatileLvl +
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  " | Stock Price: " +
 price +
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  " | Balance: " +
 balance);

 }
 }
}
```

## Before You Start

Designate 3 roles for your group:

- **Branch Maintainer:**

Actively identifies and removes obsolete branches to prevent clutter and maintain a clear development history. Responsible for the health and organization of the branches. This includes creating and deleting branches as needed, enforcing branching strategies, reviewing pull requests for adherence to best practices, and ensuring a clean and efficient branch structure.

- **PR Reviewer:**

Reviews pull requests submitted by developers, ensuring code quality, functionality, and adherence to coding standards. Provides constructive feedback, identifies potential bugs or issues, and approves or requests changes to ensure the code meets the project's requirements before merging.

- **Developers:**

Develop and implement features and bug fixes. Responsible for writing clean, well-documented code, creating and managing their feature branches, and submitting pull requests for review. Actively participate in code reviews and incorporate feedback from reviewers to improve code quality.

Depending on your group size, multiple people may need to be designated multiple roles. However, ensure your group has at least one Branch Maintainer and two PR Reviewers for this activity. Branch maintainers can be your officers or mentors.

## Branch Layout

**Do not touch the main branch.**

The main branch contains the lesson resources and starter code for students. You must make a branch off of the main to start developing your app.

You'll use the prefix `24-app` for all your branches to preserve this year's project from future student projects. Here is your branch layout, your branch maintainer should create these.

_You will create these primary branches to aid in development._

- `24-app`

The main production branch. This branch contains the stable, released version of the application.

- `24-app/[release]`

The release branch. Used to prepare a specific version of the application for release. The `[release]` portion will be replaced with a version number (e.g., `24-app/v1.0.0`).

- `24-app/development`

The main development branch. Features and bug fixes are integrated here before being merged into `24-app`.

_These are prefixes that you would add to the name of your branch. Do not create these branches._

- `24-app/feature`

Branches created for new features (e.g., `24-app/feature/buy-algorithm`). Each feature will have its branch.

- `24-app/bugfix`

Branches created to address bugs (e.g., `24-app/bugfix/buy-error`). Each bug fix will have its branch.

- `24-app/hotfix`

Branches created for urgent bug fixes to the production version. These branches will be branched directly from `24-app` and merged back into both `24-app` and `24-app/development`.

> [!NOTE]
> What's the difference between main and releases?
>
> - **`main`** is always the most up-to-date, stable version of your code. New features are integrated here _after_ thorough testing and review.
> - **`release`** is a temporary branch created from `main` specifically for preparing a particular release. Itâs a stable snapshot used for final testing and packaging before deployment. After release, it's typically merged back into `main` and then deleted. This keeps your `main` branch clean and focused on the current stable state.

Do not directly code on these branches. The purpose of these branches is to organize and separate your development of the application. Here are some examples:

- New feature or bug fix

- Branch off of `24-app/development` and name the new branch with the prefix `24-app/feature` or `24-app/bugfix` and the name of the feature/bug.
  Â  Â  - For example: `24-app/feature/sell-algorithm`
  Â  - In this branch, develop, test, and commit your changes.
  Â  - Once finished, create a pull request to merge the feature/bug into `24-app/develop`
  Â  - Request approval from developers to catch any mistakes or code conventions.
  Â  - Once approved, merge the branch into `24-app/development`

- Creating a release

- When releasing a version of your app to the main (`24-app`), you must first prepare it in `24-app/[release]` by pushing your changes from `24-app/development`. This allows for last-minute changes and minor bug fixes. Releases help the development branch to work on features that will be in the next release (however this might not be needed for a small application).

- Ensure the development branch is in a state ready for release. All features and bug fixes intended for this release should be merged into `24-app/development`.
  Â  Â  - Create a branch from development specifically for this release. We'll use `24-app/v1.0.0` as an example.
  Â  Â  - Test the `24-app/v1.0.0` branch to ensure stability and correctness.
  Â  Â  - Then you can add bugfixes or hotfixes if needed. Adding to the branch name after each addition: `24-app/v1.0.1`

- As always, when releases are stable and ready to be fully released to the public, it is merged into main. Here we need to do three things: Merge the release into main, create a tag for future reference, and merge release into development to continue work on the next release.

- Create a pull request to merge `24-app/v1.0.1` into `24-app`.
  Â  Â  - Request approval from developers to catch any mistakes or code conventions.
  Â  Â  - After approval and merge, tag the release branch with a version number. [Use this article to learn how â](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/managing-commits/managing-tags-in-github-desktop)
  Â  Â  - Then you can merge `24-app/v1.0.1` into `24-app/development`, so it contains the bugfixes and hotfixes we made in this release.

> [!NOTE]
> As mentioned, this application has a small team and doesn't require many releases. However, this process will be used in massive projects that require testing and a lot of development work. This activity will give you some experience in this space so you can understand how it works in larger projects.
